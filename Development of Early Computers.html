    </div>

    <p>
    The early development of computer can be divided into three generations.
    The very beginning of the computer era began in the 1800’s with a man by the name of Charles Babbage.
    Born in London and being an English mathematics professor, Charles Babbage came up with the Analytical Engine.
    Between 1833 and 1842, he tried to build a machine that could be programmable to do any type of calculation, and not just polynomial equations.
    The engine used punch cards to specify input and the calculations to perform.
    The engine is made up of two parts: the mill and the store.
    The mill is what performed the operations on values that it got from the store.
    The mill would be known as the CPU in present day and the store would be the memory. This shaped up the idea on what modern computers are based on.

<h3> <strong> First Generation </strong> </h3>

       <section align="center"> Atanasoff-Berry Computer <br> Dr. John V. Atanasoff (left) <br> Clifford Berry (right)</section>
    </div>


    <p>
    The first generation would be from 1937 to 1946.
    Dr. John V. Atanasoff made the earliest attempt to make an electronic computer in 1937.
    Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC) was the first electronic digital computer in 1941.
    Dr. John V. Atanasoff and a graduate student, Clifford Berry, were the ones that built it and combining their last names is how they came up with the name of the computer.
    This machine was able to solve 29 equations at the same time with 29 unknowns.
    This would be considered more of an electronic calculator, since it couldn’t be programmable.

        <section align="center"> Alan Turin <br> Colossus electronic machine (left) <br> WWII soldiers breaking code(right) </section>
    </div>


    <p>
    In 1943, a machine by the name Colossus was the second electronic machine in which Alan Turin designed it for the British army.
    This machine played a major part in breaking codes that were used by the Germans in World War II.

        <section align="center">ENIAC <br> J. Presper Eckert (left) <br> John V. Maulchy (right)</section>
    </div>
<p>
    One of the last contributions within the first generation was the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) built by J. Presper Eckert and John V. Mauchly.
    This was the first programmable computer and it is said that the computer was estimated to weighed 30 tons, and had 18,000 vacuum tubes which were used for processing.
    It took up the space of a 50 feet long basement room.

        <section align="center"> UNIVAC 1 <br> J. Presper Eckert (left) <br> John V. Maulchy (right)</section>
    </div>

    <h3> <strong> Second Generation </strong> </h3>
<p>
    The second generation would be from 1947 to 1962.
    In this generation was when computers shifted from using vacuum tubes and moved into transistors which were much more reliable.
    In 1951 was when the Universal Automatic Computer (UNIVAC 1) became the first computer for commercial use that was introduced to the public.
    It was also built by built by J. Presper Eckert and John V. Mauchly and designed to be a data-processing computer that tried to replace the punch card machines.

       <section align="center"> IBM 650 (left) <br> IBM 700 (middle) <br> Magnetic Drum (right)</section>
    </div>

<p>
    The International Business Machine (IBM) 650 and 700 series computers made a successful debut in 1953.
    About 2000 machines were produced.
    They used a magnetic drum as its main memory, data is stored in words containing ten decimal digits and a sign and it has vacuum-tube logic.
    During this generation, about 100 computer programming languages were developed and computers had memory and operating systems.
    Storage media started being used such as tape and disk and printers were being used for output.
</p>

    <h3> <strong> Third Generation </strong> </h3>

    <div class="floatright">
        <img src="Images/ThirdGenCollage.jpg" width="300px" height="100px"/>
        <section align="center">Microsoft Disk Operating System (left) <br> IBM PC (middle) <br> Macintosh (right) </section>
    </div>

    <p>
    The third generation would be from 1963 to 1990s.
    This is when integrated circuits were introduced.
    With this invention, computers became more powerful and more reliable, and this enabled them to run different programs at once.
    In 19880, the Microsoft Disk Operating System (MS-DOS) was invented.
    MS-DOS is a command line operating system in which certain command do certain operations.
    In 1981, IBM introduce the personal computer (PC) for home and office use.
    In Apple came up with the first Macintosh computer with its interface that used icons and finally in the 1990’s the Windows operating system was introduced.
    After this point, computer’s popularity had increased immensely.
    Therefor, there are too many events that have happened and it would no longer be considered early computers
